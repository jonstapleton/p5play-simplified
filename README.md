[p5play][] is a JavaScript game engine that uses p5.js for graphics and Box2D for physics.

Here's some language from the original project:

> Looking to turn your ideas into online games or interactive art? Check out p5play! It was designed by Computer Science teachers to be intuitive for beginners and well documented, making it popular at schools and universities around the world. But, p5play v3 isn't just for classroom use. It's packed with awesome features and uses the same physics simulator that powers beloved games like Tiny Wings, Shovel Knight, Limbo, Happy Wheels, and Angry Birds.

p5play (v3) was created by Quinton Ashley [@quinton-ashley][]. p5.play (v1) was created by Paolo Pedercini [@molleindustria][]. This version is maintained by [@jonstapleton][] for classroom use. I forked this version because I have concerns about the creative direction of the p5play project under its current maintainer, and the lack of stability and backwards compatibility as the project changes will cause issues for my students and other teachers using this library.
